<p>So I was really at a loss of what to do for your birthday this year...</p>
<p>But I really wanted to do something a little special.</p>
<p>However, I am usually really bad at stuff like this...</p>
<p>Especially since time is so limited >_< and trying to keep it a surprise...</p>
<p>Lets be honest, you can read me like a book. ^^</p>
<p>So I tried to think of some recent things that you liked...</p>
<p>I know that you like puppies... <br><br><span class="important">A LOOOOOOTTTT...</span></p>
<p>I also really know you like clickers...sooo....</p>
<p class="important">WELCOME TO PUPPY CLICKER! YOU CLICK AND PUPPIES BURST FORTH!</p>
